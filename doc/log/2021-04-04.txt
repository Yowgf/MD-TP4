Notes on the project MD-TP4
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Today, thank Lord Jesus, I had a sudden realization of the actual
importance of kurtosis and skew to understanding the distribution of
data... It turns out the volume of transactions in a day is a
relatively high kurtosis (~326), high skew (~13) distribution. I had
calculated these values back in the first phase of the project, but
I didn't give much attention to them.

Also, the column I created from the file "fundamentals.csv" ended up
being very far from a normal distribution.

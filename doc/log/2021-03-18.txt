I am thinking on using the people_wiki dataset for this project,
just to practice on natural language processing (NLP). If I decide
to use it, I have to remember to drop the rows where name="author)",
these are really weird, and as there are only two such rows, the
loss would be very small.

There is a question to be asked, though: can it be used for
regression purposes?

I decided not to use text data for regression. That is because
converting from text data to numerical data is too hard of a task,
and we have no time for it.

I am thinking of using the data on the New York market for the last few years now... https://www.kaggle.com/dgawlik/nyse?ref=hackernoon.com&select=fundamentals.csv

The thing is, this dataset seems too complex to me. Do I have time
to deal with it? What tasks would I try to perform?

- Predicting stock prices with data from one day before? This has
  the disadvantage of being way too simple. But stars in being
  simple and easy!  Yep, I think this is it. I have enough trouble
  from elsewhere. I can set the objectives below as secondary.
  
- Predicting bankrupcy and alike
- Mean-reversion and momentum strategies

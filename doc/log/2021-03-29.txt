Notes on the MD-TP4 project
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Today I was reading about time series data, and found out that it is
not that simple, statistically, to deal with it. I had wrong
presumptions about this...

Anyway, here is a term that I need to get acquainted with: "time
series frequency". It refers to the frequency by which data was
collected for the dataset. In our case, for the NY stock prices
dataset, it was daily. For every day, we have an entry in the
dataset, with the corresponding open, closing, low and high prices;
and the volume of transactions made in that day.

At this point I ended up deciding to just start writing the data
loading and description report. I should include all interesting
stuff about time series and so on there.
